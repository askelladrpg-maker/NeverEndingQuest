    Plot points are the key story beats that drive the adventure forward.
    Each plot point represents a major decision point or revelation.
    
    Typically include 4-8 plot points that:
    - Build upon each other logically
    - Allow for player choice (branching paths)
    - Escalate tension toward climax
    - Include both combat and non-combat challenges
    
    Example plot point:
    {
        "id": "PP001",
        "title": "The Missing Miners",
        "description": "The party learns that several miners have vanished in the

    }
    
    Key principles:
    - Each point should present a problem or revelation

    - May include side quests that start at this plot point

    Example:

    - 0 next points: Conclusion or dead end
    
    Example: ["PP003", "PP004"] means players could go to either PP003 or PP004 next
