Ensure locations:
1. Connect logically based on the map layout
2. Support the plot's needs (place key items, NPCs, and clues appropriately)
3. If a location stub already has an NPC entry (like a pre-placed antagonist), you MUST include that NPC. You can enhance their description, but their name and presence are mandatory
4. Vary in purpose and challenge
5. Include a mix of combat, exploration, and roleplay opportunities
6. Feel cohesive as part of the same {area_data.get('areaType', 'area')}

Return a JSON object with a 'locations' array containing all complete location objects.
Each location must include ALL required fields from the location schema.

CRITICAL: Field names must match the schema EXACTLY:
- Use "npcs" NOT "notableNPCs" (must be array of objects with name, description, attitude)
- Use "monsters" NOT "creatures"
- Use "lootTable" NOT "items" (must be array of strings, not objects)
- Use "connectivity" for room connections
- Use "areaConnectivity" for connections to other areas
- Use "areaConnectivityId" for area connection IDs (empty array [] if no connections to other areas, NEVER include current area ID)
- Use "plotHooks" NOT "clues"
- Use "dmInstructions" for DM-specific notes
- Use "doors" for door information (ALL fields required: name, description, type, locked, lockDC, breakDC, keyname, trapped, trap)
- Use "traps" for trap details (must include detectDC, disableDC, triggerDC, damage)
- Use "dcChecks" in format "SkillName DC XX: Description"
- Include "accessibility" (describe how easily the location can be accessed)
- Include "dangerLevel" (must be "Low", "Medium", "High", or "Very High")
- Include "features" (array of objects with name and description)

DOOR STRUCTURE: Every door must have ALL these fields:
- name (string): e.g., "North Door", "Secret Panel"
- description (string): physical appearance
- type (string): e.g., "regular", "secret", "heavy"
- locked (boolean): true or false
- lockDC (integer): difficulty to pick (0 if not locked)
- breakDC (integer): difficulty to force open
- keyname (string): what opens it (empty string if none)
- trapped (boolean): true or false
- trap (string): trap description (empty string if not trapped)

AREA CONNECTIVITY RULES:
- areaConnectivityId should be [] for locations that don't connect to other areas
- Only include other area IDs when location explicitly connects to different areas
- NEVER include the location's own area ID in areaConnectivityId

Check the location schema carefully for all required fields.
