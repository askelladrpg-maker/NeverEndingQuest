# CUMULATIVE_SUMMARY.PY - AI CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION LAYER
# ============================================================================
# 
# ARCHITECTURE ROLE: AI Integration Layer - Long-Term Memory Management
# 
# This module implements intelligent conversation compression and long-term
# memory management for extended 5th edition sessions. It solves the AI context
# limitation problem while preserving module continuity.
# 
# KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
# - Compress lengthy conversation histories into coherent summaries
# - Preserve critical game state information across context reductions
# - Generate adventure logs for long-term module memory
# - Optimize AI context for better performance and token management
# - Maintain narrative continuity during session transitions
# 
# COMPRESSION STRATEGY:
# - Event-based summarization preserving key decisions and outcomes
# - Character development tracking across sessions
# - Important NPC interaction preservation
# - Combat outcome summarization with consequences
# - Plot progression highlights and future hooks
# 
# MEMORY OPTIMIZATION:
# - Rolling window approach for recent events
# - Hierarchical summarization for older sessions
# - Key moment extraction and preservation
# - State snapshot creation for quick context rebuilding
# 
# ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION:
# - Used by conversation_utils.py for context management
# - Integrates with main.py for session continuity
# - Supports dm_wrapper.py with optimized context
# - Coordinates with party_tracker.json for state preservation
# 
# AI INTEGRATION:
# - Specialized summarization model for narrative compression
# - Intelligent event prioritization and selection
# - Context-aware summary generation
# - Multi-session continuity maintenance
# 
# This module ensures our AI can maintain coherent long-term modules
# while respecting token limitations and performance requirements.

8. Any event that would leave a lasting memory for a character or NPC (such as a heroic act, death, reconciliation, or symbolic gesture)

Use past tense and third person. Be vivid, specific, and emotional where appropriate. Focus on what actually happened—not what might happen. Avoid generic phrases.
