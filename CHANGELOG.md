## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-20

### Changed
- **Major Codebase Reorganization** for better maintainability:
  - All Python modules organized into logical directories:
    - `core/` - Core game engine (ai, generators, managers, validation)
    - `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
    - `updates/` - State update modules
    - `web/` - Web interface
  - Module builder moved to `core/generators/module_builder.py`
  - Conversation history files moved to `modules/conversation_history/`
  - Updated all import paths throughout the codebase (100% import success)
  - Fixed 47+ import issues across 22 files
  - Added comprehensive import testing tools

### Added
- AI Autonomous Module Creation system:
  - AI DM can create new modules when current adventures are complete
  - Narrative-driven module generation from rich text descriptions
  - AI parsing of embedded parameters (areas, locations, level ranges)
  - Fully agentic system - AI controls all aspects of module creation
  - Conditional prompt injection only when module completion detected
- New `createNewModule` action for AI DM
- Enhanced `module_builder.py` with `ai_driven_module_creation` function
- AI narrative parser for extracting module parameters from prose
- Module creation prompt that guides contextual adventure generation
- Interactive tabs in the web interface for viewing player data:
  - Inventory tab showing equipment, weapons, and currency

- All other output (DEBUG, ERROR, system messages, etc.) now goes to the debug panel
- Fixed issue where DM dialogue containing quotes or colons was incorrectly split between panels
- Improved detection of player status lines vs. DM content to prevent incorrect panel routing

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-17

### Added
- New `generate_prerolls.py` module that pre-generates dice rolls for all combat actions, preventing the LLM from deciding roll outcomes
- Explicit character type labeling in combat (PLAYER, NPC, ENEMY) for clearer differentiation
- Import for `generate_prerolls` function in `combat_manager.py`
- Preroll text generation before each combat round with:
  - Attack rolls

  - Ability check rolls
  - Clear labeling of creature types and relationships
- Web-based interface for the game with Flask and SocketIO:

### Changed
- Combat AI no longer determines dice roll outcomes - all rolls are pre-generated
- Enhanced creature type identification with explicit labels:
  - PLAYER CHARACTER: Controlled by the human player
  - NPC: Friendly non-player character allied with the player
  - ENEMY: Hostile monster fighting against the player
