# CONFIG_TEMPLATE.PY - SYSTEM CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE
# ============================================================================
# 
# ARCHITECTURE ROLE: Configuration Management - Central System Settings Template
# 
# This template provides the structure for config.py including API keys, model
# selections, file paths, and operational parameters. It implements our
# "Configurable AI Strategy" by allowing model selection per use case.
# 
# KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
# - API key and authentication management template
# - AI model configuration for different use cases
# - File system path configuration
# - System operational parameters
# - Environment-specific settings
# 
# CONFIGURATION CATEGORIES:
# - AI Models: Different models for DM, combat, validation, generation
# - File Paths: Module directories and schema locations
# - API Settings: Keys, timeouts, and retry parameters
# - System Parameters: Debug modes, logging levels, validation settings
# 
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
# - API keys should be moved to environment variables in production
# - Sensitive configuration should not be committed to version control
# - Copy this template to config.py and add your actual API key
# 
# ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION:
# - Used by all modules requiring AI model access
# - Provides centralized model selection strategy
# - Enables easy switching between different AI configurations
# - Supports our multi-model AI architecture
# 
# This module enables our flexible, multi-model AI strategy while
# maintaining centralized configuration management.
