## Fantasy Calendar System

This world uses a standardized fantasy calendar with the following structure:

### Months (12 months, 28 days each)
1. **Firstmonth** - The beginning of the year, winter's grip
2. **Coldmonth** - The deepest winter, frozen and harsh
3. **Thawmonth** - Winter's end, ice begins to melt
4. **Springmonth** - True spring arrives, new growth
5. **Bloommonth** - Flowers bloom, life returns
6. **Sunmonth** - Early summer, warm days
7. **Heatmonth** - High summer, the hottest time
8. **Harvestmonth** - Late summer, crops are gathered
9. **Autumnmonth** - Fall begins, leaves change
10. **Fademonth** - Deep autumn, nature prepares for winter
11. **Frostmonth** - Early winter, first snows
12. **Yearend** - The year's conclusion, winter festivals

### Calendar Structure
- Each month has exactly 28 days
- The year consists of 336 days (12 Ã— 28)
- Days are numbered 1 through 28 within each month
- When a month ends on day 28, the next month begins on day 1

### Date Format
Standard format: "[Year] [Month] [Day]"
Example: "1492 Springmonth 8" means the 8th day of Springmonth in the year 1492

### Time Tracking
- Days progress consecutively: 26, 27, 28, then 1, 2, 3 of the next month
- Time is tracked in 24-hour format (00:00:00 to 23:59:59)
- When tracking effects or durations across days, the system accounts for month transitions

### Season Associations
- Winter: Firstmonth, Coldmonth, Thawmonth
- Spring: Springmonth, Bloommonth, Sunmonth
- Summer: Heatmonth, Harvestmonth, Autumnmonth
- Autumn/Fall: Fademonth, Frostmonth, Yearend
